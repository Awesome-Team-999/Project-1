# Project-1
This page allows users to search for exoplanets by choosing certain parameters. The page retrieves information from the NASA Exoplanet API on planets fitting these parameters and displays them in a table. Users can click on an individual planet, and the program stores the name of that planet in a Firebase server, then opens a new tab with further information on that planet. From that second page, the user can enter his or her weight and find what the user's weight would be on that planet. Users can also find further information on the NASA Exoplanet website. In addition to jQuery and Bootstrap, the program utilizes the Tabulator library to create the table of planets.
